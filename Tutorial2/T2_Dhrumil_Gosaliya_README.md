## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assingnment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```
Give examples or provide a list of the required software / libraries / plug-ins

```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
npx creat-react-app sample
```

And repeat

```
npm test
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.


## Deployment
Before deploying, build your React app to create optimized production-ready files
```
npm run build
```

Start production build with 
```
npm run start
```


* [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
